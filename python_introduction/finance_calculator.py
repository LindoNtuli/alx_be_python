# A script will calculate the user’s monthly savings based on inputted monthly income and expenses
# It will then project these savings over a year,
#assuming a fixed interest rate, to demonstrate compound interest’s effect on savings.

# User Input for Financial Details:
monthly_income = int(input("Enter your monthly income:"))
monthly_expenses = int(input("Enter your total monthly expenses:"))

# Calculate Monthly Savings:
monthly_savings = monthly_income - monthly_expenses

# Project Annual Savings:
projected_savings = int(monthly_savings * 12 + float(monthly_savings * 12 * 0.05))

# Output Results:
print("Your monthly savings are $",monthly_savings)
print("Projected savings after one year, with interest, is: $",projected_savings)
